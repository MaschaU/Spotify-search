<strong>Spotify search</strong>
<p>Spotify search is a simple app that allows you to conduct searches for artists and albums and then display the results. Spotify's endpoint is reached via the 3rd party app. That app makes a request to the Spotify search API with the specified parameters and sends back the exact JSON that Spotify responds with.</p>
